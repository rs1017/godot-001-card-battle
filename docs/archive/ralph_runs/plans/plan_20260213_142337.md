- Planning data csv: data/plan_20260213_142337.csv

## Phase 1. Reference Collection
- Use eference/, esources/cards, and ssets/kaykit as the primary references.
- Record inventory and keep diffs in eference/_reports.

## Phase 2. Planning and Distribution
- Publish the current execution plan as docs/plans/latest_plan.md.
- Append deployment logs in docs/plans/distribution_log.md.

## Phase 3. Graphics Pipeline
- First choice: ComfyUI generated concepts.
- Fallback choice: KayKit assets already included in repository.
- Maintain prompt presets and usage mapping in docs/graphics/latest_graphics_strategy.md.

## Phase 4. Development
- Implement gameplay/UI changes from approved plan.
- Track touched files and impact notes in development logs.
- Card deck composition rule: tank/dps/range/spell/building role balance.
- Card rule set: mana curve, summon constraints, lane targeting, counterplay windows.
- Combat formula: damage, attack_speed, range, overtime/sudden-death scaling.
- Map rule: lane readability, tower distance band, deploy affordance.
- Victory/Defeat: explicit end-state criteria and UI transition animation.
- Card inventory: rarity/cost/tag metadata and ownership status.
- Character description: role identity, strengths, weaknesses, animation set.

## Phase 5. Review
- Run static review for regressions, state machine side effects, and data path safety.
- Write findings and open risks in docs/reviews/review_*.md.

## Phase 6. QA
- Execute headless smoke (	ools/run_headless_smoke.bat) and manual gameplay checklist.
- Save results in docs/qa/qa_*.md.
- QA fun evaluation: pace, variety, combo readability, counterplay clarity.
